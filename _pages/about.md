I am an incoming PhD Student in Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ihaiphan/">Prof. Hai Phan</a>, starting Fall 2025. Currently, I am a Senior at University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi (VNU-UET). My current research interest lies in ensuring efficiency, security and trustworthiness of LLMs. Previously, during my undergraduate, I worked on natural language processing methods for biomedical applications.
